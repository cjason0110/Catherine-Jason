         ABOUT ME SECTION
         ============================ -->
    <section id="about" class="section">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    I’m Catherine Jason, a cybersecurity student pursuing an AAS in Cybersecurity with a 3.96 GPA and hands‑on experience across networking, Linux administration, Windows Server, digital forensics, scripting, and security operations. My work includes configuring Cisco Catalyst 2950, 2960 Plus, and 3560G switches; setting up Cisco 4331 routers; administering Ubuntu Server; and managing Active Directory environments. I’ve also carried out forensic investigations using tools like E3 Forensic Platform, FTK Imager, OSForensics, and ProDiscover.
    <br><br>
    I’ve gained practical cybersecurity experience with tools including Wireshark, Nmap, SNORT, Splunk, Nessus, Metasploit, Hashcat, Aircrack‑ng, Burp Suite, and Kali Linux, along with hands‑on work in encryption, access control, and Bash scripting. My training includes the BCR Cyber Series and CompTIA‑aligned A+, Network+, and Security+ labs, which strengthened my understanding of hardware, networking, and security fundamentals through both simulator environments and real classwork.
    <br><br>
    Outside of class, I enjoy building apps and websites in VS Code, experimenting with virtual machines, and learning through personal projects, cyber ranges, and platforms like TryHackMe. I’m driven by curiosity, problem‑solving, and continuous learning, and I’m preparing for roles in security operations, network defense, and digital forensics.
